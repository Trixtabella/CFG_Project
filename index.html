            <p>Hi everyone &#128075;, I'm 31 and I'm currently working as an RPA developer. My goal is to transition into the realm of full stack development, with my initial focus on the frontend. The course has provided a fantastic foundation for my journey in this direction.  I plan to enhance and broaden the skills I've acquired, enabling me to comfortably take on a frontend development role.</p>

                <p>Hey, I'm 38 years old and currently employed as a professional in training design and delivery. I successfully completed the web development course offered by CFG, which fueled my desire to delve deeper into JavaScript. As I am being made redundant next year, I have wholeheartedly embraced the opportunity to expand my knowledge in web development. I am highly intrigued by the CFG Degree program and am seriously considering making a transition into a tech role.</p>
